Thanks for improving Botania with your artwork!

Some things to keep in mind:
1. Keep your textures in powers of two dimensions
2. Edit the jsons in models/block/, not the ones in blockstates/
3. Clean up after yourself - no texture errors on startup!
4. Some common palettes are provided in aseprite format in the textures/working_files/palettes folder, please keep the palette consistent between textures.
5. Please save your sprites in RGB color mode, not indexed (In Aseprite: Sprite > Color Mode > RGB Color)

Thanks and have at it!
