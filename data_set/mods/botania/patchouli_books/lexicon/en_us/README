README for interested people in the patchouli migration:
Things remaining to do:
- Tutorial page - the ingame tutorial might need to be ditched, video can be linked
- Head creation page - put a button linking to a website, amend text to not mention View Online
- Image pages need adjustments to their images, possibly remaking some of those images 
- Dog.
- Other reference features like Haighyorkie's fish
- Adjustments 
  - Headings - some are longer than the page, some don't exactly match the recipes (like autopicked white petal title for pages with all petals)
  - Text - some page 1 text runs off
  - Recipe adjustments
  - Page positions - eg. elven lenses, elven trades - if possible, we should make description pages and recipe pages of the same item appear at once
