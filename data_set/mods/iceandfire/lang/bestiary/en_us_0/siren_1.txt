Behold the §nnaga§r. The
beautiful mermaid gives way
to this terrifying and primal
beast, which, once its prey has
been distracted by its former
beauty, jumps into the water
and begins to attack. Since
sirens often come in groups
of two or more, these beasts
can spell certain death for
many sailors. But there is a
way to protect yourself.













By crafting and equipping
special earplugs made from
wooden buttons, one can safely
ignore the siren's call whilst
at sea. But the mermaids will
become nagas if approached.

If one manages to slay a siren,
they can obtain prismarine shards
and crystals, along with §nShiny
§nScales.§r
