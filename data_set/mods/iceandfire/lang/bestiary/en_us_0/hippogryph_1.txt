Once the beast has feasted on some
of the rabbit feet, it will lay
down and show submissiveness.
The owner can now sneak and interact
with the animal at the same time
to apply a saddle, armor or even
a storage chest.






A simple stick can be used to
command the Hippogryph to
either sit or to wander. It
is recommended that a
hippogryph is mounted when
in wander mode.








Hippogryph armor can be made
as shown above.





Finally, one can breed two
hippogryphs by feeding both
of the animals rabbit stew.
Be careful when housing
hippogryphs, as they can fly
vast distances.
