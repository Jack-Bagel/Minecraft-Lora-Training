For those who seek to hunt trolls, one
must sufficiently prepare. Trolls
cannot be harmed by arrows due to
their thick hide. They can break weak
blocks in their way. The best way to
kill a troll would be to attack it
with a melee weapon, retreat, attack,
and repeat. Another method would be
to lead a troll into sunlight, where
it would instantly petrify into stone.
However, this would lose any of the
drops a player would  hope to collect.
