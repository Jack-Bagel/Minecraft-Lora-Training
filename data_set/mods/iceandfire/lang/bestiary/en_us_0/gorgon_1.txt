Once the monster is defeated, the
brave soul who killed it can harvest
the creature's head from its body.





This head can then harness the
immense power of the gorgon to
turn whatever gazes at it to stone.
Simply hold up the severed head and
point it at any creature you would
like to turn to stone.






Anything turned to stone can be mined
with a pickaxe and will drop only
cobblestone, unless a pickaxe with
silk touch is used on the statue, in
which case it will drop a stone
statue just like itself.

Be careful, as the gorgon's head
can only be used once!
