These terrifying metal birds stalk
the swamps of the overworld and
threaten to destroy any explorer
of their territory.







Travelling in flocks ranging from
three to twenty, these birds can
rain down hellfire on their prey
with a volley of sharpened
feathers.

In close combat, the birds can
peck prey with their sharpened
metallic beaks. When further

from their prey they launch
four sharpened feathers at
their target.






These feathers can deal a great
amount of damage, and can be
retrieved from shed feathers or
once the bird is fell.




These feathers can be used to
craft extremely powerful arrows.
