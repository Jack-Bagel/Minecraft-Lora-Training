The pixies are magical and
mysterious beings that dwell
within dark or magical forest
biomes.







Pixies usually do not attack
on sight, however they are
very vain creatures and as
such will try to steal items
from people who are not
staring directly at them.
A pixie that has stolen an
item should drop it if attacked.

Most pixies live in small hovels,
gathered in strange villages under
heavy tree cover.






Pixies naturally produce pixie
dust. This dust can be harvested in
large amounts by killing a pixie or
by entrapping a pixie in a jar.
Jarred pixies produce a single
pixie dust every three days.
