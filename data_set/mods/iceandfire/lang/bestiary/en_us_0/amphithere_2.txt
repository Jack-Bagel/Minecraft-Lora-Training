On Death, amphitheres drop their
beautiful feathers.





These feathers can be used to
craft amphithere arrows.











These arrows have a special
ability: they are able to
knock back any mob with a
powerful wind gust, just
like the amphithere.

When having to dispatch
assailants, amphitheres
have a variety of attacks
to choose from. Although
they may use the generic
bite most of the time,
amphitheres can also
create a gust of wind
to knock back prey, or
slap it with their tail.
