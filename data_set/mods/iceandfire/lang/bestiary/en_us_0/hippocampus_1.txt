The beasts will follow around
those who hold these items. If
kelp is fed to the
hippocampus, it may begin to
trust the person.






If prismarine crystals are fed
to two separate hippocampi, they
will procreate and spawn an
offspring.





Once a hippocampi is tamed, a
saddle can be placed on the beast
and it can be ridden. Horse armor
and a chest can also be equipped,
in order to provide protection
and allow the animal to carry
items, respectively.

Riding a hippocampi is similar
to riding flying creatures,
except the hippocampi is
aquatic instead. Slow on land
yet extremely quick in the sea,
it is a perfect mount for
maritimers, explorers, and pirates.

Some myths even state that riding
one will allow its owner to breathe
underwater!
