The Death Worm. No other
creature terrifies desert-
dwellers more than this massive
beast. Often found digging
through sand in the deserts,
the death worm stalks man and
monster alike, although its
preferred prey is livestock.

Appearing in sand tan, bleached
white, and blood red, even
the mere appearance of the
death worm is enough to scare
many would be hunters from
slaying the beast.















Another fear many have is of
the mythical and rare Giant
Death Worm. Very few death
worms grow as large as these
do, with some being 4 times
the size as normal worms, at
over 20 blocks long.
