Â§nQueen
The queen is the sole reproductive
member of the entire colony. In
rare cases, there may be more
than one, but most colonies are
run by one single queen. This
results in her being the colony's
weakness: kill the queen, and you
kill the colony. Without a
constant stream of eggs and pupae,
the colony will quickly be
depleted and attacked. She is

armoured with an extremely
powerful stinger that can launch
attackers ten blocks away, and
bone-crushing mandibles.

Myrmex drop an assortment of
unique items that are important

Myrmex chitin can be used to
craft extremely strong weapons
