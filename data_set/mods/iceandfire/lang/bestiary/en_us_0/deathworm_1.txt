Death Worms have two major
attacks. The first and most
common of which is the
tongue grab. The Worm
will shoot forwards its
retractable tongue to grab
and injure prey.







The second and rarer attack
is for the worm to spout
forth nearby blocks into
the air. These will push
up those who stand on them

















and the falling blocks may
injure the worm's prey.
This attack scales with
the worm's size.
