    Once the lectern has been placed,
it can be interacted with by
right clicking on it. The inside 
will have three slots, the leftmost
for an input bestiary, the bottom 
for manuscripts, and the rightmost
for the output bestiary. For
every manuscript, a new
index will appear in the bestiary. 
These new pages can be
information about mythical
creatures, different types
of peoples, informative
crafting guides, and even
 basic alchemy.
