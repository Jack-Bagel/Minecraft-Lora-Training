Wither bone can also be made into
wither bone shards, which replace
flint when making dragon bone
arrows.







Dragon flesh can also be harvested
from dragons. This meat cannot be
cooked, and has different effects
based on what type of dragon it
came from. Fire Dragon flesh will

smite its eater, and Ice Dragon
flesh can slow its consumer to
a halt. All flesh sates as much
as cooked beef.







Dragon hearts can only be dropped
once by each corpse. I currently
am not aware of their purpose...
