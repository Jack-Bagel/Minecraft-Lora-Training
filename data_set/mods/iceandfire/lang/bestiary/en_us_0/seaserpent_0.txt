A distant relative of dragons, sea
serpents are vicious creatures that
live in warm oceans all across the
world.

Sea serpents are hostile to
seemingly all creatures. There is
not an animal, including sometimes
other sea serpents, they will not
hesitate to kill. Not only are
sea serpents extremely strong, but
they are also ridiculously fast.

Sea serpents will even target
prey on boats or on the shore,
as they will jump out of the
water and try to slam the
creature to death.
