Simply interact with a pixie
holding a jar to capture it.

Consuming pixie dust results
with levitation and glowing,
however it can be crafted
into something far more
powerful: ambrosia.




When ambrosia is consumed,
it restores a large amount
of health along with many
powerful potion effects.

Pixies can also be
befriended by offering them

cake. By throwing cake down
near pixies, it is likely
that one may come down to
feast on the sweet treat,
and then it will follow
whoever gifted it.

When befriended, pixies
can either follow or wait
for their friend. If a
befriended pixie is near
you, it will give you a
bonus potion effect,
depending on its color.
