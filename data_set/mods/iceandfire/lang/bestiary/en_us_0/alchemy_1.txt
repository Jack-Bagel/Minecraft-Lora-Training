When right-# clicked on a dragon,
the crystal is bound to it.
When clicked anywhere again
while in the same dimension,
the crystal will teleport
and unbound the dragon.

If the dragon is slain or somehow
not located, the crystal will not
unbind.



To unbind the crystal manually,
place it in the crafting grid
by itself.
