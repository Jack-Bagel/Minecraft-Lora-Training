These arrows seem undaunted by
gravity and are capable of continuous
flight, similar to the birds their
fletching is sourced from. They
also deal extra damage overall.

When killed, these beasts drop
assorted metals and a few of their
feathers. If a member of a
Symphalian Bird flock is killed,
the entire flock will flee from
the victor.

Any potential conquerer of the
flocks will definitely need some
sort of protection from the
projectiles of these birds.

Ranged equipment may also be
necessary for taking down the
high-flying birds.
