If either the cockatrice or its prey
is blinded, it will be forced to use
its weaker melee attacks.

Cockatrices can be a good supply of
wither bones, of which they drop on
death.





Although they inhabit savannas by


nature, there are other ways for
cockatrices to appear in the
world.




Very rarely, a chicken can lay a
rotten egg. These eggs are of
little value to a farmer, as they
cannot be prepared into food.
However, when thrown there is a
very rare chance to spawn a baby
cockatrice. These cockatrice chicks
imprint on the thrower of the egg
and will serve them for life.
