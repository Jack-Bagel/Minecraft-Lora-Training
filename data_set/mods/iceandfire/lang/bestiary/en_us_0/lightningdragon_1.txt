The most striking ability of
the lightning dragon is that
of spewing crackling lightning
from its mouth. However, they
are also in possession of a range
 of different attacks.

The dragon's lightning blast
attack fires a bolt of lightning
directly from the beast's mouth.
This attack does not ignite or
freeze the victim, yet it deals
much more direct damage than a
fire or ice blast.

The lightning bolt attack
isn't the dragon's only
elemental attack. Older
lightning dragons can also
send a charge of ball lightning
at their target, blasting away
terrain and dealing devastating
damage.
