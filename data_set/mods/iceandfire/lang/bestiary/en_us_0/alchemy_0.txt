    After harvesting dragon
blood by using a glass bottle
on a dragon's corpse, I finally
figured out how to use it
effectively as a weapon.









By combining either fire or
ice blood with a dragon bone
sword, I was able to infuse
the two and make them into
potent weapons to the
opposite dragon.







Fire Infused swords ignite
their target into flames,
and do extra damage against
Ice Dragons. Ice Infused swords
slow down their target, and do
extra damage to Fire Dragons.
Both swords also have large
knockback effects.



Dragon blood can also be used
to preserve dragons.
