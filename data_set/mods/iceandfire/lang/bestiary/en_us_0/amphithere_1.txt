Shooting an amphithere with a bow
may fell one of these creatures
from the sky and onto the ground.
Being naturally passive, the
amphithere will try and flee its
attacker.

By chasing one and mounting it,
the beast will finally begin to
fight back and rid itself of its
rider. The animal will attempt to
bite any that ride on it.

But like most animals, the
amphithere can be broken. By
somehow protecting one's self from
the dangerous biting beak of the
amphithere whilst riding it, the
animal will eventually calm down.

These broken amphitheres will then
be completely tame to their master.
Amphitheres can be flown like many
other flying creatures, and in a
similar fashion to an elytra.
By looking up, one's amphithere will
ascend, and by looking down it will
descend.

Being the protectors of the jungle,
it is only natural that amphitheres
can be bred using Cookies.

What the amphithere lacks in strength
it makes up in speed, making them one
of the fastest known forms of
transportation.
