Ghosts can also spawn into
the world when a human is
killed in a horrible manner
by another person.











Cursed chests summon a ghost
that can haunt during the
day when opened. Graveyard
soil spawns ghosts at night,
when all is dark.

Ghosts also have a chance
to drop a Phantasmal Ingot,
which can be used to upgrade
a dragonbone sword in the
smithing table into a
Phantasmal Blade.

The Phantasmal blade is a strong
sword in its own right, but
can also fire ghostly apparitions
that pass through blocks.
