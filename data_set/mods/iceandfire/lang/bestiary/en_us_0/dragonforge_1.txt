Layer 3






Construct the forge by placing
Layer 1, then Layer 2 on top of
Layer 1, then Layer 3 above Layer
2. Once the forge is complete, it
will need some sort of power.

In order to power the forge,
dragon's breath is required. This
can be achieved either by building
the structure close to a tame
dragon, or capturing a wild dragon
using chains.
