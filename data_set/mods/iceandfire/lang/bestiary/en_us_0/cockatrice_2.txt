A tame cockatrice can be made to sit,
follow or patrol by interacting with
it with an open palm. Feeding the
creature seeds will heal it. They can
also eat rotten flesh off of the
ground. Tamed cockatrices will also
fight to the death to protect their
owner.

Wild, hostile cockatrices can also be
tamed, albeit in a more dangerous
manner. By continuously staring at
the beast, it can be broken and made
to serve its better. The best method
to do this would be to trap the
creature, then look at it for short
periods so the capturer's soul does
not wither away.


Cockatrices will naturally protect
any chickens in their general area.
If any being targets a nearby
chicken, with the exception of the
cockatrice's possible owner, they
will immediately attack.

A Cockatrice's greatest enemy is
any weasel-like creature. These
small animals could easily kill
a cockatrice with just a few bites.
