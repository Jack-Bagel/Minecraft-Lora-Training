Chains can be created to capture
wild dragons and any other monster.
They can be tied to walls. Dragons
will destroy most walls, like
cobblestone walls, so those who wish
to power their furnace with a dragon
need dragon bone walls.

To properly power a forge, one must
place the chained or tame dragon
directly in front of the aperture.
Then the dragon will begin to
breathe flame or frost as long as
there are valid items in the forge.


Most items, when placed in a forge,
will be turned to ash or dragon ice
respectively. But placing an iron
ingot and dragon blood (fire blood
for fire forges, ice blood for ice
forges) will result in a powerful
alchemical metal.
