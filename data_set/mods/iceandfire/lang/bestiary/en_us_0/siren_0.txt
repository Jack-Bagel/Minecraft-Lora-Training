Woe to thee who sails near the
siren's outcroppings, for none
can resist their charms.

The siren is a creature that,
at first appears to be half
beautiful woman, and half fish.
At this stage, it is known as
a §nmermaid§r. They appear on
small outcroppings in the ocean,
and as soon as they spot a passing
ship, the mermaids will begin to
sing.

The song is extremely powerful; it
is capable of wooing nearly any
humanoid being to become
uncontrollably infatuated with
the mermaid, even forcing some to

abandon ship and swim towards the
mermaid.






But any being under the effects of
the siren will not realize that
they are being lead to their doom.
As soon as they come close to the
sirens' rock, the siren's true
form becomes apparent.
