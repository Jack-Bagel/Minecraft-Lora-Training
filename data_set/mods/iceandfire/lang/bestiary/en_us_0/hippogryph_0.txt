A Hippogryph is a strange creature
which appears to have the front of
a bird and the hind of a horse. They
are found in many diverse locations
all across the world. Yet it seems
they are attracted to hilly biomes
no matter the local climate. This
means that these creatures come in
a dazzling array of different colors
and patterns.










Most hippogryphs are predators
and will attack nearly any creature
smaller than themselves, including
people. Yet some have found a way to
tame these hostile creatures, and
are able to harness their great
speed and aerial ability.





One way of doing so is by taking
advantage of the hippogryph's
favorite food- rabbits. By
dropping many rabbit feet near
a hippogryph you might earn its
trust.
