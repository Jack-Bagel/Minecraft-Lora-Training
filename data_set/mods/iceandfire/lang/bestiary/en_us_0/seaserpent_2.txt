These arrows instead glide through
the water as if it were air.









Secondly, the scales of these
creatures can be combined with
those of hippocampus or sirens
in order to craft tide guardian
armor.




Tide guardian armor can provide
multiple benefits to its wearer.

Each piece of tide guardian
armor provides water breathing.
Each additional piece worn provides
an extra level of Strength when the
wearer is either in water or rain.

The set of armor, overall, is
slightly better than a full set of
dragon scale armor.
