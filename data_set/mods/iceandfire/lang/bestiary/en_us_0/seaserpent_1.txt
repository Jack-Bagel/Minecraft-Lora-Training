Asides from jumping out of the
water, sea serpents will also try
and bite prey that is under the
waves as well. To dispatch prey
that is further away from them,
they launch a stream of bubbles
that blast the target harshly.









Little is known about these monsters,
but from their savagery we can
deduce that they are not capable of
being tamed in any manner.
Unlike their dragon cousins, there is
no parental instinct between serpents,
so there is no way a serpent can bond
with a potential owner.

Upon death, sea serpents drop their
teeth and their scales, both of which
are valuable commodities for several
reasons.






Firstmost, the sea serpent tooth and
the sea serpent scale can be used to
create mystical arrows that do not
inundate with water like all other
types of arrow.
