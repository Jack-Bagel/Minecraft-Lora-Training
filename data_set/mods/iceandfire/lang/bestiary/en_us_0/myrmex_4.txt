Trading with myrmex is a lucrative
business. Worker trades are
usually low quality, yet they are
willing to trade some resin for
sediment and the occasional gem.
Soldiers will trade for common
mob drops, and Sentinels for
rarer ones and poisonous items.
Royals will trade for artifacts
and alchemical ingredients.
Queens trade exclusively eggs.





Myrmex Staffs can be used to
modify the structure of Myrmex
colonies. interacting with a

myrmex with one in hand will
bind it to their colony. By
using it, one can delete certain
rooms of the colony and disable
reproduction of the queen. By
using it while sneaking, one can
add a new room at their position.
One can only use this staff if
they have a reputation of 75 or
higher.

Myrmex Eggs only hatch when
underground. A queen egg, when
hatched near a player underground,
will bind to them, and the following
colony that will form will have a
permanent opinion of 100.
