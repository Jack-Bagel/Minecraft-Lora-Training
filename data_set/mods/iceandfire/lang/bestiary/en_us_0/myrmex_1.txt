§nSoldiers
Soldiers are the first line of
defense of the colony. They follow
around individuals of other castes
to protect them from other threats.




§nRoyals
Royals are the colonies' means of
reproduction, and the only members
capable of flight. Royals only fly
after a long period of mostly
idling within the colony. When two

royals mate, the male dies and the
female becomes a queen.







§nSentinels
Sentinels are the covert operations
caste of the colony. They scout out
nearby foraging routes and hide in
wait, to ambush possible prey and
predators of the hive. They are the
most deadly caste, other than the
queen.
