Ghosts are the manifestation of
the undead on the spiritual plane.
Ethereal by nature, they cannot be
destroyed using any projectile,
such as arrows or fire.

Ghosts are known to haunt the
graveyards that dot the overworld,
waiting until the veil of night
uncovers them. Ghosts can move
through any block due to their




phantasmal abilities, and have
little patience for those who
have stumbled upon their graves.

The best way to dispatch a ghost
would be a silver sword, due to
the ghosts' natural invulnerability
to fire, arrows and other earthly
weapons. Being undead, they also
take extra damage.

Ghosts may leave behind some
Ectoplasm when they die. This
can be used to craft Cursed
Chests and Graveyard Soil.
