These "tamed" worms are not
controllable in the general
sense, but they will refuse to
attack their owner or their
livestock. They grow extremely
fast, and attack most hostile
creatures. They do not follow
or abate any commands, rather
they stalk a general 50-block
radius around their spawning
ground.

Legends even speak of rare eggs
that can spawn giant death worms.
There might be a reason deserts
are full of dragon skeletons.








As legends tell it, there is even
a way to mount wild and tame worms.
Using two fishing poles, one can safely
guide a worm from above the creature,
and even order it to attack.
