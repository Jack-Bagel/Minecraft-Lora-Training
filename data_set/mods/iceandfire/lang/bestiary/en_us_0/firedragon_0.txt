    So the legends are true. Such
beasts such as the one this entry
focuses on do exist. Very well. I
shall try as well as I can to
describe such a beast and its
activities.

The appearance of the beast is
obviously reptilian. However, it
is much larger than the average
reptile; Individuals I have seen

range from the size of a pig to
25 blocks! There are even rumors
of larger dragons, sleeping in
ancient crypts under the earth.

    Another notable feature they
possess is the ability of flight.
This is indicated by the
development of large wings, used
in aviation. Although the beasts
seem sluggish at first, they can
lift off and fly swiftly after prey.
    Perhaps the most dangerous
aspect about them is their ability
to produce fire from their mouths.
They use this power to cook their
prey alive.

    Male fire dragons have patterned
wings and collect more valuable loot,
whereas females have curved horns.
