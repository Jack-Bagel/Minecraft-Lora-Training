DO NOT LOOK AT HER EYES

The gorgon is a hideous creature
that appears to be half woman,
half snake. These monstrous
abominations are one of the most
dangerous beings in the world,
capable of turning anything that
looks into their eyes to stone.









Luckily for most living things,

the gorgons are locked deep beneath
ancient stone temples. These temples
can be found on many shorelines
throughout the world.

Said temples have locked, hidden
trapdoors that can be opened by
moving the correct hidden switches
inside the building. Once the door
is opened, the adventurer can enter
the gorgon's lair.





One way to best this monster is by
creating a blindfold. The beast can
then not turn you to stone, but this
still leaves it with a venomous bite.
