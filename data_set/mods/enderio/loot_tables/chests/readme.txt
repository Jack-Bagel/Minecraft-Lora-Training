Players:

-> Nothing to see.

Modpack Makers:

-> Business as usual, these loot tables are added to the vanilla ones with the same name.
   Note that you CAN use these loot functions elsewhere.

Ender IO Developers:

-> Do NOT edit these json files. Edit LootManager.java and have the jsons re-created by LootTweaker.
   Or at least do your edits in both places, so they are not lost when these files are re-generated again.
