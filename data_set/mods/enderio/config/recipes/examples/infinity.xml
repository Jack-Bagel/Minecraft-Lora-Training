  <recipe name="Sagmill: Infinity Powder" required="true">
      <!-- Note: This recipe is not usually unusable; Ender IO does not add a way to get bedrock.
                 But if another mod does so, this will allow players to "shave off" infinity
                 powder from bedrock. As with the in-world crafting, the bedrock will not be
                 consumed. -->
