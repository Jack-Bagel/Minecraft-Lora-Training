      "text": "In the old times, long before Testificates roamed the overworld, there lived a man named Randalf. He was spawned as the seventh son of Graybeard the blacksmith, so he learned that trade from his early days. There are many tales forgotten about his work, but what is clear is that he never could deliver what his customers actually wanted. They asked for a sword and got a toolbox woth a sharp edge. They asked for a hoe and got a big box with a glowing thing in it."
